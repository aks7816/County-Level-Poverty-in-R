# County-Level-Poverty-in-R

## About
This individual project is for the state Minnesota. For this state, I was able to:

  • Acquire and clean poverty data for each county in one U.S. state.
  • Create various models for the number of people in poverty in each county.
  • Use accuracy measures for model selection.
  • Provide a 5-year forecast for each county.
  • Report the results with tables and visualizations.
